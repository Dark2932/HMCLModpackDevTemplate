# HMCLModpackDevTemplate
A template for your modpack repository.

### Features
- Develop modpack under HMCL launcher with exported modpack's files.
- Ability to pack your modpack in curseforge format (modrinth format will be produced in the future).
- Auto upload your modpack to Actions.

### Guidance
1. Click the button `Use this template`, then clone the repository to local.
2. Put **the files of your modpack**(like `modlist.html`) into the folder `modpack`.
3. Put **the launcher** into the folder `modpack` or **add a new directory then set the instance directory** in the launcher. (don't enable the `Isolated`, use the `Default`)
4. Launch your modpack and develop it!
5. Besides, if you need to manage some files, open the file `.gitignore` then operate them.
